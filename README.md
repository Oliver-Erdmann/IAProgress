# IAProgress

This is the progress that I have so far on my computer science IA. As of right now, it has checkboxes and textboxes that should add the inputs to the google sheet. I am in the process of converting it from just an html file to a chrome extension so the submit button doesn't actually do anything. Because of that, there is no way to get the inputs and put them in the google sheet.
