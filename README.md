# IAProgress

This is the progress that I have so far on my computer science IA. As of right now, it has textboxes and checkboxes that will add stuff to the activity log. There is a button to submit what you have written and checked. If there is nothing written or checked, there will be a pop-up that will say the form is not filled out. If it submits successfully, there will be a pop-up that says it submitted.There is another button to view the activity log (google sheet). Within the google sheet, their are cells that will turn green according to what checkboxes were checked.
